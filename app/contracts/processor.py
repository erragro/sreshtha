"""Contract processing orchestrator.

Advances an uploaded contract through the status machine:
    uploaded → ocr_pending → ocr_done → processing → ready
                                                  ↓
                                                failed

Each transition commits before the next stage runs so a crashed process
leaves the row at a resumable state rather than silently reverting to
'uploaded'. The status field is what the UI polls; the `stages` JSONB
accumulates output progressively so the viewer can render whatever's
ready (OCR text alone is useful even while Stage 1 is still running).

Runs as a FastAPI BackgroundTask — same worker, response already sent
to the client. Each invocation opens its own db_session because the
request that scheduled it has already been torn down by the time this
runs.
